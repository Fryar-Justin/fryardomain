                <p>We believe that one of the most affordable ways to get into quadcopters is to eliminate the consequence of crashing. Honestly, it takes some getting used to before you can aptly pilot a quadcopter. In the mean time each crash costs on average $200 or more to repair. That's if they are light crashes. Developers are coming a long way to improving the modularity of drones, thus decreasing their expense. But nothing costs less in the long run than crashing a pretent drone that will cost nothing to replace.</p>
