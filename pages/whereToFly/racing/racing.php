                    Racing is a new event that is beginning to pick up steam. You don't have to go to some scenic place that specializes in racing to do it. It can be as simple as setting up some kind of obstacle course in your back yard! But if you've got that desire to go to an official tournament than this is the place to be. We try to scour the country for tournaments and how you might attent. Keep watching for updates!
