                    Someone once said, the only thing that remains the same is change.

                    That statement is certainly true in quadcopter politics. So many people are annoyed with pilots flying these machines over their homes and at times spying on them. I don't blame them. Can you imagine the surprise and frustration to have a drone suddenly hovering next to your living room window looking in?

                    Politics are slow to catch up but they are always evolving and changing. The purpose of this site is to communicate these changes as best as we can.
