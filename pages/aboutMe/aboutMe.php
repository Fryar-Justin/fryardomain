                <p>I have always enjoyed technology. I think it is fascinating how you can design a system to automate tasks or monitor things. When I was a kid we had a toy called an <a href="/pages/aboutMe/images/big24.JPG">Armatron</a>. It was so much fun to play with and I was fascinated with the fact that I could remotely control an arm that could pick up and move things! My favorite thing to do was to place it near the cat and even though it was pretty loud I was once in a while able to snag the cats tail with the clamp.</p>
                <p>Since then I have always been interested in remote control equipment and the possibilities of quadcopter drone technology is simply an extenuation of that. The idea of hiking to the base of a mountain and then sending up a drone to look and explore the peak is fascinating. There are other types of drone technology that allows for long distance flight of several miles. These are not quadcopter type drones but they are remotely controlled.</p>

                <p> My wife and I have been married for 9 years. They met at Brigham Young University-Idaho in a 
                    Spanish class and have been together ever since. </p>

                <p> They enjoy the outdoors including camping, mountain biking, yard work, gardening, home renovations
                    and carpentry. We make a point to go hiking every week with the family.</p>

                <p> We have three boys Liam, Declan and Carson. Liam is nearly 8 and in 2nd grade. 
                    Declan is nearly 6 and a busy 1st grader who loves school. Carson is nearly 3 and jumps on top of anyone who gets within range and he loves attention.</p>
