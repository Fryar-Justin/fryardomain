    <h1>Site Plan</h1>
    <h2>Site Purpose Statement:</h2>

    <p>fryardomain.com is going to be a sight designed to help make some headway into the realm of quadcopter racing. This is a new field that has just cropped up and from what I can tell only in the last year or so. It is beginning to make news headlines and many people are beginning to search on the internet for it. There are beginning to have more and more venues open for this budding sport yet it can be difficult to find them or even know how to start. My website will include information about these events.</p>

    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>

    <p>My audience I believe will be between the ages of 12+ with higher concentrations in the 16-18 year range. Individuals that visit my site will, for the most part, not have a great knowledge of quadcopter equipment. I believe this will be a very interesting part of the site that will draw attention. This portion of the site doesn’t need to have just lists of good parts but an educational factor to it. If I could create possibly some videos that educate the viewer on this sport and quadcopters in general. This will be a fairly expensive sport so I expect visitors to have at least moderate access to money and so should have a decent education or success in the working environment. This site will be viewable on desktop computers and mobile phones. I would like to create an apple and android app for this but that will be outside of the scope of this course and timetable I have to make it. Later down the road perhaps.</p>

<h2>Male Persona:</h2>

<p>My name is Aaron. I live in Loveland, Colorado and I work as a photographer. I have always enjoyed photography and film making. I graduated with a BFA (Bachelors of Fine Arts) in Filmmaking. Since then I began doing side work for things like weddings, adventure tours, and real estate. The real estate bit of my business has really picked up recently. In this part of my business when a house goes up for sale it needs to be listed on the local MLS site. I take fantastic photographs of the house that are coupled with the listing and help it to sell better. I recently added 3D photography to my services and I am investigating Quadcopter photography. I would use this to take ariel photographs of the house and the surrounding neighborhood to also with with the listing. It will add a new and unique perspective that will intrigue realtors and viewers alike. Because my field of study is in photography and not operation of a quadcopter I don’t know much about the equipment being used, gyroscopes or anything else. I am starting from scratch at this point. I need to know equipment costs, operating costs, what happens if it crashes etc. I would also like to know the local laws and limitations of flying this “drone.” What are my liabilities? I’m also fascinated at the idea of taking these drones with me on hikes in the mountains and using the drones for photography up there. What are the implications of doing this?</p>

<h2>Female Persona:</h2>

<p>My name is Sara. I live in Salt Lake City, Utah and I am a Nurse. I don’t know anything about technology and especially not in drones. So why am I looking at them? I have an older child of 4 aged 16. He has expressed a lot of interest in quadcopter drones. More specifically he wants to race them. The younger kids are starting to become interested as well but one thing at a time. I am concerned with the legalities of drones such as no fly drones and what happens say if you fly into someones car or their house or a stranger. I also don’t know much about the costs of getting into this hobby. It would be nice if you had a starter kit that I could look at and buy and also some videos on the legality of drones. I am considering buying this for my child for christmas and I don’t know much. Educate me!</p>

<h2>Scenarios & Content List:</h2>
<ul>
<li>What are the legalities of quadcopter racing? Where can I fly it? Do I need to be licensed?</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these questions have everything to do with the current legislation and is constantly changing in an attempt to catch up to the technology. My site will contain a legalities section that will give the latest information on what is happening in that field. I would need to be careful to offset any accountability on my part having dispersing false or out of date information.</p>
<ul>
<li>How will I know where to go to see these races?</li>
</ul>
<p>My site will have a localities page designed at the beginning to point people towards events happening in the Colorado area. Eventually it will spread to other states.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I enter a race?</li>
</ul>
<p>The site with local races will also contain a contact method for each of these events. This may be as simple as an email address and phone number but could also include links to the organizers website if available. In an attempt to simplify the site and keep regular maintenance low I do not plan to make a method of entering the race through my site itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>What equipment do I need to get started?</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be contained in the educational portion of the site. It will feature beginner videos that will explain the basics of quadcopter flight and how it works.</p>
<ul>
<li>What other things can I go with a drone?</li>
</ul>
<p>The site will contain ideas and possibly areas where you can legally fly a drone such as in the mountains or over water, with warnings of course. Many people don’t consider the possibilities of drones and you can give them ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>What skill training is available?</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people don’t have the money to spend $300 or $400 every time they crash to fix their drone. There are simulators that can be purchased that use the actual controller of the quadcopter and it’s much cheaper to crash a simulation than it is the real thing. If there are also any trainers available in the area I would list those with some reviews from some other clients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where can I fly my drone just for fun?</li>
</ul>
<p>I will include a list/map of areas that are drone friendly and fun to fly in</p>

<h2>Content List:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Home Page - Will contain quadcopter artwork in the header illustrating racing events and construction of the drone. It will have 3 articles along with the main. These articles will include “Just Starting Out”, “Equipment”, and “Blog” excerpts.</li>
    <li>About Me - Image of myself, short excerpt about my interests in drones.</li>
