                    <h1>River Kayaking Adventure</h1>
                    <h2>Guide: <a href="../../guides/personnel/tiffany.php">Tiffany Heroff</a></h2>
                    <p>The Lower Gorge of the Salmon carves its way through history to expose metamorphosed volcanic and ominous granite gorges. To compliment the gorges, roomy white sand beaches are common on this 53 mile stretch of river – perfect for camping, swimming, or taking an afternoon nap. You will float through the Seven Devil’s canyons, a landscape difficult to visit for non-river travelers. Catch a glimpse of a river otter, cougar, bear, golden eagle, or bighorn sheep in this diverse landscape. Visit river crossings used by the Nez Perce Indians in their flight from the U.S. Calvary in 1877. Your instructors will help fine tune your technique while running the rapids or floating through calm pools.  By building upon skills every day, students find this kayak course to increase comfort levels on the river astronomically. For many of our guests, the time spent at camp is as enjoyable as the time spent floating on the river. After an exciting day on the river, your instructors and guides will cook you a healthy and delicious meal while you relax at the river’s edge on warm, sand beaches. In the evening, campfires (weather permitting), songs, and stories will carry you to a fulfilling night’s sleep under the stars.</p>
