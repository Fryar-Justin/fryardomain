                <p>"The ride was peaceful while also being fun. We didn't want to go on anything particularly scary and the guide did not disappoint. He knew the area and the places to avoid. He was personable and very funny! I didn't know exactly what to expect and honestly was afraid at times. But the guide talked me through those areas and was very outgoing. I can't wait until we come back again next year!"<br><br> Elizabeth Delficki</p>
                <p>"I was pretty experienced in fishing and knew, pretty well anyways, the technique required. But the guides on this fishing tour taught me things I had never thought of. They were very knowledgeable not only with fishing but also with the area. The guide could tell me exactly where the good spots and the bad spots were. He could tell me which areas were busy at which times of year. He could even tell me what kind of bait to use! I was amazed with his experience and know how and I look forward to seeing him again"<br><br>Jason Bourne</p>
                <p>"I love kayaking, it is my favorite thing to do in the world! I had been searching all over the country for a good place to go and found several. But none of them could compare to the service this company offered to their customers! They checked and suggested supplies I should take with me on my trip and even gave advice on certain bends in the river that other had found difficult to navigate. I was impressed with their knowledge in the area and their willingness to part their wisdom to me. Highly recommend!"<br><br>Melinda OsBourne</p></div>
